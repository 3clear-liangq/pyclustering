    abstract="This paper presents the results of a study of synchronization processes in oscillatory neural networks of various structures based on the Kuramoto model. The estimates of synchronization processes occurring in the oscillatory networks are examined. The results of studying the practical application of oscillatory networks for solving cluster analysis problems are presented.",

Change notes for 0.6.dev0 (start Jul 18, 2015)

General changes (pyclustering):
- Implemented phase oscillatory network syncpr (pyclustering.nnet.syncpr).
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/208

- Feature for pyclustering.nnet.syncpr that allows to use ccore library for solving.
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/232

- Optimized simulation algorithm for sync oscillatory network (pyclustering.nnet.sync) when collecting results are not requested.
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/233

- Images of english alphabet 100x100.
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/commit/aa28f1a8a363fbeb5f074d22ec1e8258a1dd0579


General changes (ccore):
- Implemented phase oscillatory network for pattern recognition syncpr.
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/232


Corrected bugs:
- Bug with callback methods in ccore library in syncnet and hsyncnet that may lead to loss of accuracy.

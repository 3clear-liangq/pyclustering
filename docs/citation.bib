abstract="In this paper a new approach to hierarchical clustering of huge data sets is presented, which is based on a Grid-Clustering approach [Sch96]. It uses a multi-dimensional grid data structure, the BANG structure, to organize the value space surrounding the pattern values. The patterns are grouped into blocks and clustered with respect to the blocks by a topological neighbor search algorithm.",
